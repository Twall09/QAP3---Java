Instructions:
You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below in whatever way you can but please answer the following questions/points as part of your submission:

1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

    I would say roughly 6-8 hours broken into sections

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

    Lecture recordings, notes, and some google research

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

    No, no friends involved.

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

    No, no instructors invovled.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

    I never found it too difficult other than Problem 3 and 4 were a little tricky. I think where it never displayed a guide,
    it took some research for that. Sometimes coding Java can be time consuming, but other than that it is not too bad.
